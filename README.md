# Record Company Management System
Overview
This C++ project is a comprehensive Record Company Management System designed to efficiently manage records and customer data for a record store. The system employs various data structures to organize and retrieve information, ensuring optimal performance and reliability.

## Features
Membership System: Every customer is assigned a unique ID and phone number. Customers can opt for a membership card, and those with a membership card pay for their purchases at the end of each month.

Record Prizes and Discounts: The system supports occasional prizes for random members, providing them with discounts on their purchases.

Dynamic Record Management: The system adapts to changes in the number of records and their purchases each month. Record IDs are enumerated from 0 to the total number of records minus 1.

Record Company as a Data Structure: The record company itself is represented as a data structure, coordinating the interactions between customers, records, and membership features.
